                    <p style="text-align:left;">The American Physician Scientists Association
                        at UC Berkeley is a student organization dedicated to spreading awareness about the
                        MD-PhD path. APSA prepares its members for training and development as physician-scientists
                        through clinical and professional networking, providing resources for academic success,
                        and inspiring students to pursue careers as research physicians through community outreach and education.
                        Past members have gone on to do remarkable research in prestigious labs and get into top tier programs across
                        the world like Stanford, UCSF, and NUS.</p>

                                        who have by now joined MD/PhD programs, are starting residency, and/or work
                                        in labs. They keep in contact with the club to help create outreach
                                        events like field trips to their programs and panel events</p>

                                        aspect of an MD/PhD, our club has grown stronger as a close-knit community.
                                        That is perhaps why our club lives on to this day.
